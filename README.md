# mlpWeatherLabeling

This software created a MultiLayerPerceptron to fit a multi-class classification to recognize weather event. The forecasting model is based on MLP with only hidden-layer with 50 eurons, 10 input neurons, dinamic output neurons in base the number of labeling; regarding iper-parameters this machine learning softwar, use as loss function the "categorical_crossentropy" and as optimizer "adam".
This software extract csv file created by using Weather Labeling Web App; it will be downloadable from url https://github.com/CCMMMA/Weather-Labeling-Web-Application
